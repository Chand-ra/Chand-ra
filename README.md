ğŸ˜„ I am an undergraduate Mathematics student at SVNIT, Surat, India with a passion for everything tech! I love geeking out about new technologies and discovering the ingenuity of old ones.

ğŸŒ± I have currently finished learning basics of some languages like C and Java and indulged in implementations of some elementary algorithms and data structures.
I hope to find myself a place in the open source community and learn from some amazing projects and people.

ğŸ“« How to reach me: The easiest way would be to drop me an email but I wouldn't mind a DM in any of my social handles either.
